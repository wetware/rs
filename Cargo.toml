# Patch libp2p-kad to fix QueryId generic parameter bug
#
# Issue: libp2p-kad 0.48.0 has a compilation bug in the bootstrap() method signature.
# The method returns `Result<QueryId<QueryResult::Bootstrap>, NoKnownPeers>`, but
# QueryId is defined as `pub struct QueryId(usize)` with no generic parameters.
# This causes compilation errors:
#   - error[E0573]: expected type, found variant `QueryResult::Bootstrap`
#   - error[E0107]: struct takes 0 generic arguments but 1 generic argument was supplied
#
# Fix: The patch changes line 985 in behaviour.rs from:
#   `Result<QueryId<QueryResult::Bootstrap>, NoKnownPeers>`
# to:
#   `Result<QueryId, NoKnownPeers>`
#
# When to remove: This patch can be removed once libp2p-kad releases a version
# that fixes this bug (likely 0.48.1 or later). Check the libp2p-kad changelog
# or GitHub issues for when this is fixed upstream.
#
# Related: libp2p 0.56.0 depends on libp2p-kad 0.48.0, so we cannot avoid this
# patch without downgrading the entire libp2p ecosystem, which would require
# cascading dependency downgrades.
