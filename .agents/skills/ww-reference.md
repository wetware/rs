# Browse Reference

Deep-dive into schemas, CLI, and shell commands.

## Start with what they need

Don't present a wall of options cold.  Ask:

> What are you looking up?  If you tell me what you're trying to
> do, I can point you to the right thing.

If they already know what they want, jump straight there.

If they want to browse, show the menu:

## How to present reference material

When walking through a `.capnp` file:
- Explain each interface and method in **plain language first**
- Then show the schema definition
- One interface at a time — don't dump the whole file

For `schema-inject`, run `cargo run -p schema-id --bin schema-inject -- --help`
yourself and show the user the actual CLI output.  Then walk through
the three modes with examples:
- `--raw bitswap` — raw libp2p streams
- `--http /api/v1` — HTTP/FastCGI routing
- `--capnp schema.bytes [--no-ipfs]` — typed Cap'n Proto RPC

Note: `--no-ipfs` (capnp only) skips pushing canonical schema bytes
to IPFS via Kubo.  Useful offline or when Kubo isn't running.
Protocol IDs for raw cells must not contain `/` (host prefixes
`/ww/0.1.0/stream/` automatically).

For effects, walk through the three forms:
- `(perform :keyword data)` — raise a keyword effect
- `(perform cap :method args...)` — raise a cap-scoped effect
- `(with-effect-handler target handler body)` — install a handler
  (keyword or cap target; use inline kwargs for multiple keyword
  handlers: `(with-effect-handler :k1 fn1 :k2 fn2 body...)`)

Explain the handler stack (dynamic scope, newest-first matching)
and one-shot `resume`.  Read `crates/glia/src/effect.rs` for the
implementation.  Emphasize: effects are the *only* way to cross
the process boundary — anything not wrapped in an effect is local.

## After each topic

Suggest other `/ww-*` skills as appropriate.
